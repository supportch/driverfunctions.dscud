| load\_cal        | If TRUE, the board will retrieve the calibration settings for the selected A/D range from the EEPROM and store it in the calibration circuit before performing the A/D conversion. This results in higher accuracy but causes a slight delay of a few milliseconds. If FALSE, the board will use the current calibration settings and start the A/D conversion immediately. Once a particular A/D range's calibration settings are loaded into the board, they will remain loaded until the board powers off or a new set of settings is loaded. When the board powers up, it automatically loads the settings defined as the boot mode. The boot mode is set with the autocal function. | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT  |
| scan\_interval   | <p>Determines the time delay between consecutive A/D conversions during an A/D scan operation. When you perform an A/D scan, the individual A/D samples will be spaced apart by exactly this amount of time. The time delay affects the maximum possible sample rate. For example, if you want to achieve a 100KHz sample rate, the maximum scan interval is 1/100KHz = 10 microseconds.</p><p>0 20 microseconds (default value)</p><p>1 15 microseconds</p><p>2 10 microseconds</p><p>3 5 microseconds</p><p>4 9 microseconds</p><p>5 4 microseconds</p>                                                                                                                                | Diamond-MM-16RP-AT  |
