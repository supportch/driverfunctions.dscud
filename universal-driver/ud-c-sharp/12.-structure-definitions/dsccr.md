Structure containing information on all counters. This is used for functions operating on 82C54 counters.

## Structure Definition

```csharp
    public struct DSCCR
    {
        public byte control_code;   /* [INPUT] Counter command byte.- Refer Board manual for specifics */

        public byte counter_number; /* [INPUT] Counter number to which the settings are being applied. */

        public uint counter_data;   /* [INPUT] Data to set the counter to */

        public DSCCS counter0;      /* [OUTPUT] Counter 0 data read */

        public DSCCS counter1;      /* [OUTPUT] Counter 1 data read */

        public DSCCS counter2;      /* [OUTPUT] Counter 2 data read */

        public byte control_bit;    /* [INPUT] Used in conjunction with control_code */

        public int CtrClock;        //Clock source, must be 2 or 3 (see FPGA specification for usage)

        public int CtrOutEn;        //1= enable output onto corresponding I/O pin; 0 = disable output

        public int CtrOutPol;       //1= output pulses high, 0 = output pulses low; only used if CtrOutEn = 1

        public int CtrCountDir;     /*0 = down counting, 1 = up  counting*/

        public int CtrReload;       /*0 = one-shot counting, 1 = auto-reload (repetitive counting, only works in count down mode)*/

        public int ctrOutWidth;     // 0-3   0 = 1 clocks, 1 = 10 clocks, 2 = 100 clocks, 3 = 1000 clocks , only used if  CtrOutEn = 1 and CtrClock = 2 or 3

        public int CtrCmd;          /*Counter command, 0-15 (see FPGA specification for available commands)*/

        public int CtrCmdData;      /*Auxiliary data for counter command, 0-3 (see FPGA specification for usage)*/

        public float ActRate;       //Actual rate resulting from the closest divisor available for the desired rate

        public int Start;           //0 = donâ€™t start counter after configuration; 1 = start counter after configuration

        public int GateEn;          //0 = no external gate; 1 = external gate enabled in RMM1616
