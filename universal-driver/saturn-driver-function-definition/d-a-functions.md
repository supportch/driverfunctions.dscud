# D/A Functions

### **BYTE SATURNDASetSettings(BoardInfo\* bi, int Channel, int Range, int OverRange, int ClearEnable, int LoadCal);**

This function is designed to work with the AD5755 / AD5755-1 D/A converter. This function configures the following settings for a single output channel.

* Output range set via input parameter
* Overrange is enabled/disabled via input parameter
* Clear enable/disable set via input parameter
* Output is enabled
* External resistor is selected (to match board physical configuration)
* DC/DC converter is enabled
* Calibration settings may optionally be recalled

All D/A channels are configured for 0-5V during board initialization, and the unipolar calibration settings are loaded into the D/A chips at power-up or reset. If the application requires any other ranges, then each channel that uses a different range must have its settings configured independently by calling this function prior to using the channel. The driver should keep track of the output range set for each channel in order to know what is the 0V output code for each channel.

The proper method for changing the output range on the AD5755 DAC is as follows:

1\.       Set output to 0V / 0mA code (0 or midscale)

2\.       Write to DAC control register with the new output range; INT\_ENABLE = 1, DCDC = 1 (for current ranges), and OUTEN = 0 to disable the output

3\.       Recall calibration settings if desired or if a current output range is selected (4, 5, or 6)

4\.       Write the existing output value to the DAC data register

5\.       Write to DAC control register again with the new output range; INT\_ENABLE = 1, DCDC = 1 (for current ranges), and OUTEN = 1 to enable the output

### **BYTE SATURNDASetSim(BoardInfo\* bi, int Simup);**

This function configures the board for simultaneous update or regular single-channel update mode.

Input parameters:

|       |     |                                                              |
| ----- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Simup | int | 0 = single-channel update mode, 1 = simultaneous update mode |

This function operates as follows:

Set page = 1

Write Simup to register 5 bit 0 (DASIM)

Set page = 0

Exit

### **BYTE SATURNDAConvert(BoardInfo\* bi, int Channel, unsigned DACode);**

This function outputs a value to a single D/A channel. The output range must be previously set with DASetSettings(). If the board is not set for simultaneous update mode (DASIM = 0), the channel will be updated immediately after the DAC internal calibration circuit is finished. If the board is set for simultaneous update mode (DASIM = 1), the channel will not be updated, and a separate update command must be executed.&#x20;

The software must keep track of the output code written to each channel since this is needed when changing the output range.

Input parameters:

|          |          |         |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| Channels | int      | 0-3     |
| DACode   | unsigned | 0-65535 |

In the description below, n = A for channels 0-3, B for channels 4-7, C for channels 8-11, or D for channels 12-15.

&#x20;

This function operates as follows:

Set page = 1

Wait for DABUSY = 0 in register 7 // must wait for any previous operation to finish before writing again

Return timeout error if DABUSY does not return to 0 within the specified time limit

Write the D/A code to registers 0 and 1

MSB = Channel

Write MSB to register 2

Read DASIM bit (register 5 bit 0)

If DASIM = 1 then exit // simultaneous update mode is in effect so donâ€™t update now

Wait for DABUSY = 0 in register 7 // must wait for calibration circuit to finish before updating DAC

Return timeout error if DABUSY does not return to 0 within the specified time limit

Write 1 to command bit DALDn in register 6 to update DAC

Set page = 0

Exit

### **BYTE SATURNDAConvertScan(BoardInfo\* bi, int\* ChannelSelect, unsigned\* DACodes);**

This function outputs multiple values to multiple D/A channels. The output ranges must be previously set with DASetSettings(). If the board is not set for simultaneous update mode (DASIM = 0), each channel will be updated immediately by the hardware after being written to. If the board is set for simultaneous update mode (DASIM = 1), the channel will not be updated, and a separate update command must be executed. This function simply calls SATURNDAConvert() once for each channel to be updated. It is mostly used for simultaneous mode operation where all channels will be updated at the same time after all data is written.

Input parameters:

|               |             |                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ChannelSelect | int \*      | 0 = donâ€™t update channel n, 1 = update channel n |
| DACodes       | unsigned \* | 0-65535 for each channel to be updated           |

This function operates as follows:

For i = 0 to 15

If ChannelSelect\[i] = 1 then call SATURNDAConvert() with Channel = i and DACode = DACodes\[i]

Next i

Set page = 1

Read DASIM bit (register 5 bit 0)

If DASIM = 0 then exit // simultaneous update mode is not in effect so DACs will be updated already

Wait for DABUSY = 0 in register 7 // must wait for all previous operations to finish before updating DACs

Return timeout error if DABUSY does not return to 0 within the specified time limit

Write 0x80 to register 6 // DASIMUP command

Set page = 0

Exit

### **BYTE SATURNDAFunction(BoardInfo\* bi, unsigned DAData, int DACommand);**

Input parameters:

|           |          |                                           |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| DAData    | unsigned | 16-bit value in straight binary 0000-FFFF |

This function operates as follows:

Set page = 1

Wait for DABUSY = 0

Return timeout error if DABUSY does not return to 0 within the specified time limit

Write DAData to registers 0 and 1

Write DACommand byte to register 2

Set page = 0

End

### **BYTE SATURNDAUpdate(BoardInfo\* bi) ;**

This function is used to update the D/A when it is set for simultaneous mode (DASIM = 1) and the programmer is not using the DAConvertScan function. In this case the programmer is using DAConvert multiple times to write channel data individually. At the end of all these functions, the update command is needed to update all channels at once.

Input parameters:

None&#x20;

Function steps:

Set page = 1

Read DASIM bit (register 5 bit 0)

If DASIM = 0 then exit (simultaneous update mode is not in effect so DASIMUP command will have no effect)

Wait for DABUSY = 0 in register 7

Return timeout error if DABUSY does not return to 0 within the specified time limit

Write 0x80 to register 6 // DASIMUP command

Set page = 0

Exit

If slew rate is enabled, the slew operation may be monitored by checking the Ramp Active bit in the status register using the SATURNDARead() function.

Input parameters:

|           |     |                                                                             |
| --------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Channel   | int | 0-3                                                                         |
| Enable    | int | 0 = disable slew rate control on this channel, 1 = enable slew rate control |
| SlewClock | int | if Enable = 1, this value is used to program the update rate; range 0-15    |
| SlewStep  | int | if Enable = 1, this value is used to program the increment; range 0-7       |

This function operates as follows:

Set page = 1

If Enable = 0 then:

Wait for DABUSY = 0

Return timeout error if DABUSY does not return to 0 within the specified time limit

Write 0x0000 to registers 0-1 // set SREN bit to 0 to disable slew rate function

Command = 0x1C  + Channel

Write Command to register 2

If Enable = 1 then:

Wait for DABUSY = 0

Return timeout error if DABUSY does not return to 0 within the specified time limit

Data = 0x1000 + SlewClock << 3 + SlewStep // set SREN bit to 1 to enable slew rate function

&#x20;               Write Data to registers 0-1

Command = 0x1C  + Channel

Write Command to register 2

Set page = 0

Exit
