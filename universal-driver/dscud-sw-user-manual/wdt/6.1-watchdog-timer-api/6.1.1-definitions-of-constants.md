# 6.1.1 Definitions of Constants

The definition of these constants is the same for both the Prometheus and Hercules (as long as the constant is supported by the board.)

| Constants                            | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XXXX\_WD\_TRIGGER\_SCI               | <p>1 = Watchdog counter 1 will generate SCI on time-out </p><p>0 = no SCI occurs.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| XXXX\_WD\_TRIGGER\_SMI               | <p>1 = Watchdog counter 1 will generate SMI on time-out </p><p>0 = no SMI occurs.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| XXXX\_WD\_TRIGGER\_RESET             | <p>1 = Watchdog counter 1 will generate a hardware reset immediately on time-out. In this case WD2 serves no purpose, since its function is to delay the assertion of hardware reset from the timeout of WD1. However a valid load value for WD2 must still be supplied to the function.</p><p>0 = no hardware reset occurs now (hardware reset will still be generated upon timeout of WD2).</p> |
| XXXX\_WD\_WDI\_ASSERT\_FALLING\_EDGE | <p>1 = WDI will retrigger the watchdog timer on a falling edge. </p><p>0 = WDI will retrigger on a rising edge.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| XXXX\_WD\_WDO\_TRIGGERED\_EARLY      | <p>1 = output on WDO will be generated one clock cycle before counter 1 times out. In this case, WDO can be used to retrigger WDI by wiring the two signals together. This causes a bypass condition that prevents the watchdog timer from ever timing out. </p><p>0 = output on WDO will be generated when watchdog counter 1 times out (normal operation).</p>                                  |
| XXXX\_WD\_ENABLE\_WDI\_ASSERTION     | 1 = hardware trigger input WDI will retrigger watchdog timer circuit and reload counter 1. Software retrigger command may also be used. 0 = input signal WDI is disabled; only software retrigger command may be used.                                                                                                                                                                            |
