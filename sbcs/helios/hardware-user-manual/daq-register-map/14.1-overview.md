# 14.1 Overview

The data acquisition circuit on the AV model of Helios uses an FPGA which is attached to the ISA bus. It is accessible via a 16-byte window in ISA I/O space. It can be enabled or disabled in the BIOS. Select Chipset, then South Bridge Configuration, then GPCS. Select “Enabled” or “Disabled”, and then select the desired base address. The default settings are Enabled and address = 280 (meaning 0x280 – 0x28F). The&#x20;

available address options are: 200, 240, 280, 2C0, 300, 340, 380, 3C0&#x20;

If the FPGA is disabled you will not be able to use the data acquisition circuit. The chosen address must not conflict or overlap with any other CPU feature or installed add-on board. Most Diamond I/O boards have a default I/O address of 300, so that address should not be used for the on-board data acquisition if a Diamond I/O board is installed.&#x20;

The table below provides a high level overview of the register functions. Detailed bit by bit descriptions are in the next section.
