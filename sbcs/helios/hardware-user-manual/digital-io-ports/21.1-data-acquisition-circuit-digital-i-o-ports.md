# 21.1 Data Acquisition Circuit Digital I/O Ports

These 3 ports are called A, B, and C and are accessible on the data acquisition I/O connector J17. Ports A and B can be configured as either input or output, and each half of port C can be configured independently for input or output. The data is read and written with the registers at base+8 through base+10, and the direction configuration byte is located at register Base+11. See the detailed register description in chapter 14 on page 46.&#x20;

To use these ports, first configure the desired directions by writing the appropriate configuration value to base+11. Then read or write data to the 3 I/O ports as needed. All I/O ports are in input mode on power-up or after a board reset.&#x20;

The upper 4 bits of port C serve dual purposes. If control bit DIOCTR=0, these bits are normal DIO lines and can be read or written via the register at base+10. If DIOCTR=1, these bits are reassigned as counter/timer signals:

| J17 Pin No.  | DIOCTR = 1  | DIOCTR = 0 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| 21           | Gate 0      | DIO C4     |
| 22           | Gate 1      | DIO C5     |
| 23           | Clk 1       | DIO C6     |
| 24           | Out 0       | DIO C7     |
