# 12.2 Serial port Configuration

The serial port settings can be configured in the BIOS menus. Select the Chipset menu, then South Bridge Configuration, then Serial Port Configuration to modify the address, IRQ level, speed, and protocol. The default settings are shown below.

| Available options for each port: |                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Address (hex):**               | 3F8, 2F8, 3E8, 2E8, 3A8, 2A8, 100, 108                                         |
| **IRQ level**:                   | 3, 4, 9, 10, 11                                                                |
| **Baud rate:**                   | 2400, 4800, 9600, 19,200, 38,400, 57,600, 115,200                              |
| **Protocol:**                    | <p>COM1 and COM2: RS-232, RS-422, RS-485 </p><p>COM3 and COM4: RS-232 only</p> |

Each serial port requires 8 bytes of address space starting with the base address selected. So for example, an address of 3F8 means an address range of 3F8 â€“ 3FF.&#x20;

Be careful to select unique vales for each port. Selecting the same value for more than one port will cause a conflict and lead to unpredictable behavior.
