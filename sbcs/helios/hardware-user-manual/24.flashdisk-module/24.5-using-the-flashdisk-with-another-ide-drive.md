# 24.5 Using the FlashDisk with Another IDE Drive

The flashdisk occupies the board’s 44-pin IDE connector and does not provide a pass-through connector. To utilize both the flashdisk and a notebook drive, the Diamond ACC-IDEEXT adapter is required, along with 44-wire cable number 6981004. The 44-wire cable carries power from the SBC to the adapter board and powers the flashdisk module and any drive using a 44-pin connector, such as a notebook hard drive.&#x20;

A drive utilizing a 40-pin connector, such as a CD-ROM or full-size hard drive, requires an external power source through an additional cable. The power may be provided from the SBC’s power out connector, J5, or from one of the two 4-pin headers on the ACC-IDEEXT board. Diamond Systems’ cable number 6981006 may be used with either power connector to bring power to the drive.
