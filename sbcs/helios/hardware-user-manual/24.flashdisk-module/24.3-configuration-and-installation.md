# 24.3 Configuration and Installation

The flashdisk module contains a jumper block J1 for master/slave configuration. For master mode, install the jumper over pins 1 and 2. For slave mode, install the jumper over pins 2 and 3. The photo above shows Master mode (pin 1 is the lower pin near C16 / R12).&#x20;

The flashdisk can also be configured for write protection. To write-protect the full disk, solder an 0603 or 0805 size 0-ohm resistor across pads 3-4 of jumper block J2 on the right side of the board (indicated as R8 on the silkscreen). With the resistor in place, the files can still be read, but the disk cannot be written or erased.&#x20;

The flashdisk module installs directly on the IDE connector, J12, and is held down with a spacer and two screws a mounting hole on the board. The mounting hardware is included with the flashdisk in hardware kit 6801008. The Helios SBC may already include the mounting spacer, in which case only the top side screw is required.
