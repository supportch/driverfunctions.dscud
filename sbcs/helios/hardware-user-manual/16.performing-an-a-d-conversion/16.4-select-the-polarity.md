# 16.4 Select the Polarity

Select the polarity from among the available options in the table in section 15.2. If the polarity is the same as for the previous A/D conversion it does not need to be set again. Write this setting along with the singleended/differential setting to the register at page 2 base+13. To access page 2, the page must be set with the page register at base+1.&#x20;

outp(base+1, 2);                  // set page&#x20;

outp(base+13, 0x00);          // example: sets bipolar, single-ended&#x20;

outp(base+13, 0x08);         // example: sets unipolar, single-ended
