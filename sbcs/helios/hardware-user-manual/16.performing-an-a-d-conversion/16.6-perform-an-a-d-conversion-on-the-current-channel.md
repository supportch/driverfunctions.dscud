# 16.6 Perform an A/D Conversion on the Current Channel

After the above steps are completed, start the A/D conversion by writing to the ADSTART bit at base+0. This write operation only triggers the A/D if AINTE = 0 (interrupts are disabled). When AINTE = 1, the A/D can only be triggered by the on-board counter/timer or an external signal. This protects against accidental triggering by software during a long-running interrupt-based acquisition process.&#x20;
