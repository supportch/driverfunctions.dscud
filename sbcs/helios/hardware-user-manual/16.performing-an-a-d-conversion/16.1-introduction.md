# 16.1 Introduction

This chapter describes the steps involved in performing an A/D conversion on a selected input channel using direct programming (without the driver software). Perform an A/D conversion according to the following steps. Each step is discussed in detail below.&#x20;

1. &#x20;Select the input channel range.&#x20;
2. &#x20;Select the input range and scan option.&#x20;
3. &#x20;Select the polarity.&#x20;
4. &#x20;Wait for analog input circuit to settle.&#x20;
5. &#x20;Initiate an A/D conversion.&#x20;
6. &#x20;Wait for the conversion to finish.&#x20;
7. &#x20;Read the data from the board.&#x20;
8. &#x20;Convert the numerical data to volts or engineering units.&#x20;

The control registers associated with A/D conversions are provided below for reference:
