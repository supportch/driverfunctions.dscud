# 11.8 Quiet / Quick Boot / Splash Screen

Quiet boot replaces the system status and configuration screen that appears during startup with a blank screen or custom splash screen (if available). Quick boot turns off memory test during startup to save time. To enable these features, go to the Boot menu, then select Boot Settings Configuration. Diamond can provide custom splash screens upon request from an image file no larger than 22KB in size.
