# 11.1 Entering the BIOS

The BIOS may be entered during startup by pressing the DEL key on an attached keyboard or pressing F4 if using console redirection. Press the key repeatedly right after power-on or reset until the BIOS screen appears. After a certain amount of time during startup, the BIOS will ignore the DEL or F4 key. If you wait too long and the system does not respond, simply reset the board (or power down) and try again. BIOS setup screens are in 640x480 resolution regardless of the screen resolution programmed in the BIOS. For optimum use of the BIOS setup screens, be sure to select a resolution of 640x480 or higher. After you are finished with BIOS configuration, you can update the BIOS with a lower resolution if desired.
