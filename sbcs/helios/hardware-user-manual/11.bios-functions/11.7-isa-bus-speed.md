# 11.7 ISA Bus Speed

The ISA bus default speed is 8.3MHz. It can be set to 16.6MHz for increased performance. The number of wait states can also be modified for optimum performance. Not all add-on boards will support higher speed or different wait state settings. If your system does not behave reliably, reset the settings to their default values.
