# 11.5 ISA Bus IRQ Reservation

An ISA bus IRQ must be reserved in the BIOS in order to be used by the on-board ISA bus circuits (serial ports and data acquisition) or an installed PC/104 module. To reserve an IRQ, go to the PCIPnP menu and scroll down to the IRQ list at the bottom. The default settings are: IRQ3, 4, 5, and 7 reserved, the remaining IRQs available.
