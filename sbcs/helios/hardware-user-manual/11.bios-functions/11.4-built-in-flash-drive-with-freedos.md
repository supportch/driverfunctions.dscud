# 11.4 Built-In Flash Drive with FreeDOS

Helios contains a built-in 8Mbit (2MB) flash memory pre-loaded with a ready to run copy of FreeDOS. This flash memory can be set up as a bootable A: drive. About 1.5MB of space is available for file storage. To enable the flash drive, select the Boot menu, then Boot Settings Configuration. Scroll down to OnBoard Virtual Flash FDD, and select “External”. You can also write-protect the on-board flash drive to protect the files from being erased. To do this, select “External Read Only” instead of “External”. To ensure that write protection is not disabled later, you should assign a password to the BIOS using the Security menu. To make the flashdisk the primary boot device, select the Boot menu. For 1st Boot Device, select “SCSI Card”. Now the Helios can power up and boot to DOS without any attached storage device.
