# 11.9 Boot Priority

To select Boot devices and priority, go to the Boot menu and highlight the devices with the cursor and using ENTER select from the available devices. The order you wish them to be accessed is based on the number of the menu item (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th Boot Device). Only devices which are currently attached to the board will appear in the list of options. Therefore if you want to select a hard drive or USB device as the boot device, you must connect it to the CPU first, then boot up and enter the BIOS, then select it as a boot device. If this menu option does not appear on the screen, it means that the on-board flash drive is not enabled, and either no boot devices are attached or the CPU does not recognize any attached boot devices
