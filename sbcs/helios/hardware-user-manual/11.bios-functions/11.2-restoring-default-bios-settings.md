# 11.2 Restoring Default BIOS Settings

When you make changes to the BIOS settings, the new settings are stored in a battery-backed CMOS RAM built into the Vortex processor. If you want to restore the BIOS settings to their defaults, you can do that by erasing the CMOS RAM using the following procedure.

1.  Connect a keyboard to the PS/2 keyboard port and connect a monitor. Erasing CMOS RAM is not

    available with console redirection.
2. Reboot the CPU (reset or power-down and power-up).
3. Hold down the END key while the CPU is booting.
4. The board will boot up normally. The BIOS settings will be reset to their defaults.
