# 25.1 ACC-IDEEXT FlashDisk Programmer Board

The FlashDisk Programmer Board, model number ACC-IDEEXT, may be used to connect both a flashdisk module and a standard IDE hard drive or CD-ROM drive to the Helios SBC to allow file transfers to/from the flashdisk during system setup. The board can also be used to connect a flashdisk to a desktop computer to transfer files to the flashdisk.&#x20;

The ACC-IDEEXT comes with a 44-wire cable no. (DSC number 6981004) and a 40-wire cable no. (DSC number C-40-18) for connection to external drives. The flashdisk module is sold separately.&#x20;

Both 40-pin .1-inch spacing and 44-pin 2mm spacing pin headers are provided on ACC-IDEEXT for connection to the flashdisk and a hard drive or CD-ROM drive. A dedicated connector, J2, is provided for the flashdisk module. It also provides a flashdisk mounting hole for permanent installations. The IDE cable, DSC nnumber 6981004, is normally used to connect the board to the SBC using one of the other 44-pin connectors. Any two devices may be connected simultaneously using this board with proper master/slave jumper configurations on the devices.&#x20;

To connect a flashdisk + IDE notebook hard drive to the Helios, connect one end of cable 6981004 to the SBC, and attach the other two connectors to the ACC-IDEEXT and the hard drive.&#x20;

To connect a flashdisk and CD-ROM to Helios, connect one end of cable 6981004 to the SBC and the other end to ACC-IDEEXT, and connect the C-40-18 (or a standard desktop IDE cable) from the 40-pin connector on ACCIDEEXT to the CD-ROM. Power needs to be provided to the CD-ROM separately. The two 4-pin connectors J5 and J6 provide +5V power from the 44-pin cable and are compatible with a standard floppy drive connector. Note carefully the voltage indicators on the connectors. Red on the floppy drive cable is +5V and yellow is +12V. +12V is not present on the 44-pin connector or the ACC-IDEEXT.&#x20;

To attach the ACC-IDEEXT to a desktop computer, attach the desktop 40-pin IDE cable to the 40-pin connector on the board and then provide power to J5 or J6 using the PC hard drive / floppy drive power cable. Note carefully the voltage indicators on the connectors. Red on the floppy drive cable is +5V and yellow is +12V. +12V is not present on the 44-pin connector or the ACC-IDEEXT and is not needed for operation.
