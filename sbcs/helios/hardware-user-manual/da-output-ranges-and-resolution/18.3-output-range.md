# 18.3 Output Range Selection

The D/A output range is determined by the values of the register bits DAPOL, DAG!, and DAG0 in the register at page 2 base+14. When a value is written to this register, the D/A range for the selected channel will be set to the selected value. Each D/A channel can have its own range. To set all channels to the same range, set bit DAUR=0 when selecting the output range. To set a channel to its own range, set DAUR=1 and then select the channel using bits DACH1-0

| DAPOL  | DAG1  | DAG0  | DAC output range or function |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ---------------------------- |
| 0      | 0     | 0     | 0 to 5V (unipolar 5V span)   |
| 1      | 0     | 0     | ±2.5V (bipolar 5V span)      |
| 0      | 0     | 1     | 0 to 10V (unipolar 10V span) |
| 1      | 0     | 1     | ±5V (bipolar 10V span)       |
| 0      | 1     | 0     | Not Used – Setting Ignored   |
| 1      | 1     | 0     | ±10V (bipolar 20V span)      |
