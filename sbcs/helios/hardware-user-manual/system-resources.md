# 8. SYSTEM RESOURCES

![](broken-reference)

Most of these resources are configurable and, in many cases, the operating system alters these settings. The main devices that are subject to this dynamic configuration are on-board Ethernet, sound, video, USB, and any PC/104-Plus cards that are in the system. These settings may also vary depending on what other devices are present in the system. For example, adding a PC/104-Plus card may change the on-board Ethernet resources. The serial port settings for COM1 and COM2 are jumper-selectable (J25, J26), whereas the settings for COM3 and COM4 are entirely software-configured in the BIOS.
