# 8.1 Using built-in ‘fsck’ to fix disk

fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux file systems. The file system can be a device name (e.g. /dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2), a mount point (e.g. /, /usr, /home). If the M.2 SATA is booted to terminal, then type the following command. \
\
&#x20;                                     _$fsck /dev/sdxx_

The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following conditions:

* 0 - No errors
* 1 - File system errors corrected&#x20;
* 2 - System should be rebooted
* 4 - File system errors left uncorrected
* 8 - Operational error
* 16 - Usage or syntax error
* 32 - Fsck canceled by user request
* 128 - Shared library error

If file system errors not corrected, then re-flash the image in M.2 SATA which is provided as backup in DVD. To reflash refer step 3 in [Appendix G](../9.-appendices/appendix-g-dd-command-for-image-backup.md)
