&#x20;                                                                            _$fdisk –l_

&#x20;The above command will list storage devices names connected to the PC, find out the M.2 SATA based on size from the displayed list.

Once the M.2 SATA device name is found (e.g /dev/sdc) then type the following command in terminal

&#x20;                                               _$ fsck /dev/sdc_
