# 6.2 Configuring Linux to match the provided runtime image

* Install additional utilities on Ubuntu image

&#x20;             The user may require utilities like Eclipse IDE, partition manager, minicom etc. The freshly installed\
&#x20;             Ubuntu-OS will not have those utilities by default. To install required additional utilities refer   \
&#x20;             [Appendix J](../9.-appendices/appendix-j-install-additional-utilities-in-ubuntu-os.md).

* Configure HTTP, FTP and SSH server

&#x20;             Refer [Appendix B](../9.-appendices/appendix-b-configuration-of-ftp-server.md), [C](../9.-appendices/appendix-c-configuration-of-http-server.md) and [D](../9.-appendices/appendix-d-configuration-of-ssh-server.md) respectively

* Create new user and password if required

&#x20;              Refer [Appendix H](../9.-appendices/appendix-h-to-create-and-change-of-root-user-password-ubuntu-new-user-creation.md)

* Enable automatic login option if required

&#x20;              Refer [Appendix K](../9.-appendices/appendix-k-automatic-login-option.md)&#x20;

* The Ubuntu-20.04.2 LTS kernel version 5.4.x has required drivers to support all the peripherals present in the Saturn board and now the Linux image is ready for the Saturn board.\

* The next step is obviously to take a copy of the Saturn Linux image refer [Appendix G](../9.-appendices/appendix-g-dd-command-for-image-backup.md)
