# 6.2 To remove driver from and offline image by using DISM tool

* At an elevated command prompt, locate the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) servicing folder, and type the following command to retrieve the name or index number for the image that you want to modify. For example, type: \
  \
  &#x20;           **Dism /Get-ImageInfo /ImageFile:C:\test\images\install.wim**\

* Mount the offline Windows image. For example, type:

&#x20;                   **Dism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:C:\test\images\install.wim /Name:"Windows Drive"** \
&#x20;                  **/MountDir:C:\test\offline**

* Remove a specific driver from the image. Multiple drivers can be removed on one command line. For example, type:

&#x20;                   **Dism /Image:C:\test\offline /Remove-Driver /Driver:OEM1.inf /Driver:OEM2.inf**

* Commit the changes and unmount the image. For example, type:

&#x20;                   **Dism /Unmount-Image /MountDir:C:\test\offline /Commit**
