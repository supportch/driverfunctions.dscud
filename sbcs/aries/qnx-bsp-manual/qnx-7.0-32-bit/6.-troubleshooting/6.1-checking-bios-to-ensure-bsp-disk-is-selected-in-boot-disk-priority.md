# 7.1 Checking BIOS to ensure BSP disk is selected in boot disk priority

The BIOS setup screen may be entered during startup by pressing the Delete key on an attached keyboard. Press the key repeatedly right after power-on or reset until the BIOS screen appears. After a certain amount of time during startup, the BIOS will ignore the Delete key. If you wait too long and the system does not respond, simply reset the system (or power down) and try again.

During SBC startup, press Delete key to enter BIOS setup screen.
