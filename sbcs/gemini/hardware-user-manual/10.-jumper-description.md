## 12.1 JP1 Serial Termination Jumper

Gemini provides option termination resistors for RS422 and RS485 protocols.&#x20;

When loaded a 121-Ohm resistor is connected across differential pairs. JP1 jumpers are not loaded by default.&#x20;

The label number corresponds to silkscreen labels on PCB for pin locations.

| Label | Jumper Pins | Function                                  |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1     | 1-2         | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 1 TX |
| 2     | 3-4         | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 2 TX |
| 3     | 5-6         | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 1 RX |
| 4     | 7-8         | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 2 RX |
| 5     | 9-10        | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 3 TX |
| 6     | 11-12       | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 4 TX |
| 7     | 13-14       | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 3 RX |
| 8     | 15-16       | 121 Ohm Termination for  Serial Port 4 RX |

## 12.2 JP2 Peripheral voltage selector

On Gemini, JP2 provides an option to select PCI I/O voltage level, LCD supply voltage, and LCD backlight supply voltage. The pinout is designed to prevent the possibility of shorting two supply voltages if loaded correctly.

The table below shows jumper settings for JP2. The default setting is highlighted in **Bold**.

| Label Position | Voltage Selection |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1-2 Left       | V-PCI = 5V        |
| **2(across)**  | V-PCI = 3.3V      |
| 3(across)      | V-LVDS = 3.3V     |
| **3-4 Left**   | V-LVDS = 5V       |
| **5-6 Right**  | V-Backlight = 12V |
| 6(across)      | V-Backlight = 5V  |

## 12.3 JP3 Serial Port Protocol Selector and USB Mux selection

Gemini has jumper JP3 to select the Serial protocols for serial port pairs and USB 2.0 signals for  USB to I2C bridge or mini-card socket.

The serial port labels and associated functions are specified in the table below.

Jumper labels 2 and 3 must be used for serial protocol selection of Ports 1 and 2. Jumper labels 4 and 5 must be used for serial protocol selection of Ports 3 and 4.

| Label 2/4 Jumper IN/OUT (Mode 2) | Label 3/5 Jumper IN/OUT (Mode 0) | Protocol |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| **OUT**                          | **IN**                           | RS232    |
| IN                               | IN                               | Loopback |
| OUT                              | OUT                              | RS422    |
| IN                               | OUT                              | RS485    |

USB 2.0 jumper option is as given below(default option in **Bold)**:

| Label                 | Function           |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Label 1 Jumper IN/OUT | USB 2.0 Assignment |
| **IN**                | GPIO Expander      |
| OUT                   | PCIe MiniCard      |
