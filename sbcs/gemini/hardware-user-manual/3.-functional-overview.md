# 5. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW

## 5.1 Power Supply Specifications

\
Gemini carrier board is powered by a wide range of power supply ranging from +8V to +36V DC. The maximum permissible reflected ripple measured at the power input connector is +/-100mV p-p.

All required supply voltages for the board are derived from the 8V-36V DC input. The maximum power required for the carrier board with COM Express module loaded and addon-cards installed is 95W.&#x20;

Note: The power output from the main power controller will be low at lower input voltage range. Minimum input voltage may not be 8V and it will increase based on the COM Express module's power consumption.

## 5.2 Backup Battery

A 2x1 right angle connector is available to support an external RTC battery connection. The Voltage level for RTC is 3V.&#x20;

The Current requirement for RTC: 4uA.

Back-up time for CR2032: 56250 hours

## 5.3 Digital I/O&#x20;

Gemini includes a CP2112 USB to GPIO expander to provide 8 GPIO lines which are accessible on a 2x5 2mm pitch pin header. All GPIOs are 3.3V compatible. CP2112 is a USB to SMBus bridge IC which has 8 GPIO lines. Gemini is making use of these GPIO lines for DIO capability. CP2112 is USB HID IC. No additional drivers are required.

USB to GPIO is shared with mPCIe socket. GPIO is selected as default. A jumper selects which device is active.

Refer to [section 11](10.-jumper-description.md) for jumper details.

## 5.4 Display Output Controller

Gemini has 3 video output ports available, one LVDS and 2 HDMI. Simultaneous video output on 3 video ports is supported.

### 5.4.1 LVDS LCD Connector

Gemini supports a 24-bit dual-channel LVDS display accessible on a 2x15 right-angle latching connector. The backlight supply and PWM control signals are provided on a separate right-angle connector. The backlight supply and LCD supply are user selectable using the JP2 jumper to support multiple LCD displays.

{% hint style="info" %}
For enabling the LVDS display eDP/LVDS should be enabled and the LFP panel type resolution should be set as 1920x1080.
{% endhint %}
