# 17. DIGITAL I/O

## 17.1 DIGITAL I/O specification

Each digital I/O line can be individually configured to set the input or output direction. This enables the Digita I/O pins to be split as input and output. All lines can be individually read or written, enabling I/O peripherals configurations to be customized to suit application requirements. The output pins can be set as open-drain or push-pull.

| Digital I/O Specifications |                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Device                     | CP2112                                   |
| Number of Lines            | 8                                        |
| Direction                  | Bidirectional, Programmable bit by bit   |
| Input voltage              |                                          |
| Logic 0:                   | 0V min: 0.6V max                         |
| Logic 1                    | 2.31 min: 3.3V max                       |
| Output Voltage             |                                          |
|  Logic 0:                  | 0.0V min: 0.6 max @ 25mA output current  |
| Logic 1                    | 2.9V min @-10mA output current: 3.3V max |

Since the Digital I/Os are realized with USB to GPIO expander, the Digital I/Os do not support additional features such as edge detection on input, PWM features on output, etc, but can only be used to write and read logic high & logic low.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Digital I/O pins are not 5V tolerant.

## 17.2 DIGITAL I/O Software

The CP2112 USB to I2C bridge is configured to be an HID device so separate drivers are not needed for this device.&#x20;

Silicon Labs provides an SDK for the CP2112 device which can be used to program the Digital I/Os. Click [here](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/interface/cp2112ek-development-kit) to download the SDK for the CP2112 device.

The mapping table below represents DIO signals from CP2112 IC to J33 DIO connector.
