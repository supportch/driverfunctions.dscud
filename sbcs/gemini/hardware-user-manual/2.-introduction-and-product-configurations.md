# 3. INTRODUCTION & PRODUCT CONFIGURATIONS

## 3.1 Introduction

### 3.1.1 Gemini COM-based SBC

Gemini COM-based SBC is the newest addition to Diamond Systems product-line that integrates the latest generation of the embedded COM Express® Compact cExpress-WL 8665UE Type 6 Module from ADLINK, featuring Intel® 8th Generation Quad-core i7 processor, and PCI/104-Express Expansion.

Gemini COM-based SBC offers a scalable embedded system infrastructure that significantly enhances performance, power efficiency, and optimized I/O capabilities.

The SBCs mechanical dimensions slightly exceed the dimensions of the COM Express Compact form factor and PC/104 specification form factor so that mounting hole patterns of both form factors can be accommodated. This also allows additional space for I/O connectors.

The PCI/104-Express expansion sockets are located on the top side of the board. The COM Express module is mounted on the bottom side of the board.

The SBC is a multi-layer Printed Circuit Board that is designed on a thicker scale measuring .090” (2.3 mm). This enables the carrier board to operate reliably in mobile and harsh environmental applications.

The following table summarizes the on-board key features, components, and specifications of the Gemini COM-based SBC.
