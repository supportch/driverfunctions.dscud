# 6.2	Configuring Linux to match the provided runtime image

* Install additional utilities on Ubuntu image
* The user may require utilities like Eclipse IDE, partition manager, minicom etc. The freshly installed Ubuntu-OS will not have those utilities by default. To install required additional utilities refer [Appendix J](../9-appendices/appendix-j-install-additional-utilities-in-ubuntu-os.md)
* Configure HTTP, FTP and SSH server
* &#x20;Refer [Appendix B](../9-appendices/appendix-b-configuration-of-ftp-server.md), [C](../9-appendices/appendix-c-configuration-of-http-server.md) and [D](../9-appendices/appendix-d-configuration-of-ssh-server.md) respectively
* Create new user and password if required
* Refer[ Appendix H.](../9-appendices/appendix-h-to-create-and-change-of-root-user-password-ubuntu-new-user-creation.md)
* Enable automatic login option if required - Refer [Appendix K](../9-appendices/appendix-l-automatic-login-option.md)
* Place latest Diamond systems universal driver at /usr/local directory.&#x20;
* The Ubuntu-20.04.1 LTS kernel version 5.4 has required drivers to support all the peripherals present in the Athena-IV board and now the Linux image is ready for the Athena-IV board.
* The next step is obviously to take a copy of the Athena-IV Linux image refer [Appendix G.](../9-appendices/appendix-g-dd-command-for-image-backup.md)
