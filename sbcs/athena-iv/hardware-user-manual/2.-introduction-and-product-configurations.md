# 2. INTRODUCTION & PRODUCT VARIANTS

## 2.1 Introduction <a href="#id-2-1-introduction" id="id-2-1-introduction"></a>

Athena IV is the fourth generation in the Athena family of rugged, wide-temperature PC/104 SBCs with integrated data acquisition, extending back to the original Athena in 2002. Athena IV is an excellent choice for:

* Customers using previous generations of Athena seeking to extend the lifetime of their existing product;
* Customers seeking to replace an obsolete PC/104 SBC with a newer generation one to extend their existing product’s lifetime; or
* Customers seeking to build a PC/104 system expected to have a long lifetime.

**Advantages of a CoM-based architecture**

Athena IV uses a CoM Express Type 10 “mini” Computer-on-Module (CoM) to provide the core CPU functionality, mounted on a carrier board that provides the PC/104 expansion and the remaining I/O circuitry.

The use of a CoM instead of a directly soldered CPU circuit provides several key advantages and benefits:

* Higher feature density: a 2-board solution provides twice the PCB area in the given footprint, allowing more circuitry and more features to be included.
* Longer lifetime: Since all CoMs in a given form factor support essentially the same features, if the CoM becomes obsolete or unavailable, a newer one can be used in its place, usually with minimal re-engineering.
* Performance scalability: CoM Express modules are available from a number of suppliers around the world with multiple processor and memory options, allowing a single design to be used for a range of applications. For a lower-end application, choose a low-power, low-performance COM. For a higher end application, choose a higher performance COM. In both cases the rest of the system remains identical, allowing your investment in engineering and product design to be reused multiple times.
* Easier access to newer generation CPUs: Most processors enter the market initially in the form of COMs. By using a COM-based SBC, you can gain access to the latest generation of CPU sooner than waiting for a true SBC with that processor to be available. Again, upgrading is simple since the rest of the system remains unchanged.

## 2.2 Processor Module

The standard Athena IV processor details are as follows:

| Processor               | Features                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Intel E3845 Bay Trail   | 1.91GHz Quad Core, 4GB RAM            |
| Intel E3940 Apollo Lake | 1.6GHz Qaud Core, 8GB RAM, 64GB eMMC  |
| Intel E3950 Apollo Lake | 1.6GHz Quad Core, 8GB RAM, 128GB eMMC |

Athena IV can also be used with other Type 10 CoM Express Mini modules. Contact Diamond Systems Sales to know more about the usage of CPU modules other than the E3845 Bay Trail processor.

Athena IV can also be purchased as a carrier board separately and customers can use the CPU module of their choice. Contact Diamond Systems Sales to discuss more regarding this option.

Even though Athena IV can be used with other CPU modules, customers are advised to consult their module vendors as there could be some BIOS modifications required especially when using ISA cards on the PC/104 bus.&#x20;

## 2.6 Athena II to Athena IV Evolution

Each generation of Athena maintained the same physical shape and most of the I/O connectors and features of the previous generations, while updating key features to stay current with the state of the art. In this way the Athena platform has maintained a low-impact migration path for customers with extended product lifecycles that outstrip the lifetimes of the CPU. Many customers have been able to maintain their products for up to 16 years as a result.

Due to advances in technology, not all features of Athena II / III are maintained. Here is a table of differences between the products:

| Feature       | Athena II                                                  | Athena III                                                                                        | Athena IV                                                                                                                          |

## 2.7 Product Variants

The standard configuration of Athena IV is the **A-Model.** In this configuration, Athena IV contains a Data Acquisition sub system.&#x20;

The data acquisition circuit on Athena IV includes 16 channels of 16-bit A/D, 4 channels of 12-bit D/A, and 24 channels of digital I/O. The analog inputs feature single-ended and differential configuration, programmable input ranges, and fault-protected channel multiplexors to protect against over voltages. The D/A channels feature programmable output ranges and simultaneous update capability.

To meet further customer requirements, Athena IV also comes in a custom assembly option called the **N-Model**. In this model, the Data Acquisition subsystem is excluded. The N-Model has comparatively lower cost than the A-model but since this is a custom build, it would require an MOQ on the purchase. Consult Diamond Systems Sales to explore more about this model.
