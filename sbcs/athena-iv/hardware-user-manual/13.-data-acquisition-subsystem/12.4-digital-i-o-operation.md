# Digital I/O Operation

Athena IV contains 24 digital I/O lines organized as three 8-bit I/O ports: Port A, Port B, and Port C. The direction of each port is programmable, and port C is further divided into two 4-bit halves, each with independent direction. The port data are accessed at registers Base+8 through Base+10, and the port direction register is located at Base+11.

| **Base +** | **7**  | **6** | **5** | **4** | **3** | **2** | **1** | **0** |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 8          | PA7    | PA6   | PA5   | PA4   | PA3   | PA2   | PA1   | PA0   |
| 9          | PB7    | PB6   | PB5   | PB4   | PB3   | PB2   | PB1   | PB0   |
| 10         | PC7    | PC6   | PC5   | PC4   | PC3   | PC2   | PC1   | PC0   |
| 11         | DIOCTR | -     | -     | DIRA  | DIRCH | -     | DIRB  | DIRCL |

The digital I/O lines are located at pins 1 through 24 on the I/O header J14. The lines are 3.3V output compliant and 5V logic input tolerant. Each output is capable of supplying â€“12mA in logic 1 state and +24mA in logic 0 state.

&#x20;DIRA, DIRB, DIRCH, and DIRCL control the direction of ports A, B, C4-7 and C0-3. A direction value of 0 means output and 1 means input. All ports power up to input mode and the output registers are cleared to zero. When a port direction is changed to output, its output register is cleared to zero. When a port is in output mode, its value can be read back.&#x20;

DIOCTR is used to control the function of lines C7-C4 on the I/O connector. When DIOCTR = 1, the lines are port C7-C4. When DIOCTR = 0, the lines are used for the counter/timer.

| **Pin No.** | **DIOCTR = 1** | **DIOCTR = 0** | **Pin direction for DIOCTR = 0** |
