# 12. JUMPER DESCRIPTION

## 12.1 Serial Port & DIO pull-up/pull-down Configuration \[JP1]

The 2x6 2mm jumper JP1 is used to:

1. **Select the protocol for the serial ports**
2. **Enable the pull-up or pull-down on the DIOs**

### 12.1.1 Select the protocol for the serial ports

The serial port protocol mode selection is as tabulated below:

![JP1 configurations for serial ports protocol selection](broken-reference)

By default, the serial ports' outputs are disabled to prevent any accidental damages to the port pair.

![JP1 configured for serial ports 1, 2, 3 & 4 in (a) RS-232 (b) RS-485 (c) RS-422 modes](broken-reference)

The protocol selection remains same for serial ports 1 & 2 and serial ports 3 &4 ie inserting a jumper on location 5 on JP1 configures the both serial ports 1 & 2 in RS-232 mode

### 12.1.2 Enable the pull-up or pull-down on the DIOs

The on-boards DIOs can be pulled up or down with the help of jumper JP1.The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP1 configured to enable (a) Pull-down (b) Pull-up on the DIOs](broken-reference)

## 12.2 LVDS Scan & Mapping \[JP4]

The 2x2 2mm jumper JP4 is used to set the scan direction & mapping for certain LVDS displays. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![LVDS display configured for (a) Normal scan & map A (b) Reverse scan & map B](broken-reference)

## 12.3 LVDS LCD Panel Voltage Select \[JP5]

The 1x7 2.54mm jumper JP5 is used to configure the LVDS LCD panel voltages. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP5 configurations for LVDS LCD VDD & backlight inverter VDD](broken-reference)

![JP5 configurations for (a) LCD VDD = 3.3V, Backlight inverter VDD = 5V (b) = LCD VDD = 5V, Backlight inverter VDD = 12V](broken-reference)

## 12.4 ISA Base Address \[JP6]

A part of 2x9 2mm jumper JP6 is used to configure the base address of the A/D circuit. The configurations are tabulated below:

![JP6 A/D ISA Base Address Settings](broken-reference)

![A/D ISA Base Address Configurations](broken-reference)

## 12.5 ISA IRQ \[JP6]

A part of 2x9 2mm jumper JP6 is used to configure the IRQ for the serial COM ports & A/D IRQ. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP6 IRQ settings for COM3, COM4 & A/D](broken-reference)

![IRQ configurations for COM3, COM4 & A/D](broken-reference)

## 12.6 Termination Enable for Serial Ports \[JP7, JP8]

The two 2x5 2mm jumpers JP7 & JP8 are used to enable the 121E termination for the serial ports in RS-422 & RS-485 protocol modes. To enable the 121E termination for RS-422 & RS-485 modes, appropriate jumpers are mounted. The jumpers are removed to disable the 121E termination for RS-232 mode. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP7 & JP8 Termination enable configuration for RS-422 & RS-485 protocol modes](broken-reference)

![Termination jumper configurations for (a) RS-232 (b) RS-422 or RS-485](broken-reference)

In RS-232, make sure to remove all the jumpers as the serial ports might end up failing due to the 121E termination on the communication lines

## 12.7 SPI Select \[JP9]

The 2x3 2mm jumper JP9 is used to configure the SPI lines to the FPGA SPI flash & enable the board power in absence of CoM. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![JP9 configurations for SPI select & board power enable](broken-reference)

![JP9 configurations for (a) CS# control (b) SPI & CS# control (c) Board power enable](broken-reference)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Jumper on JP9 location 4 should never be mounted in presence of CoM. Mounting like this may damage the CoM
{% endhint %}

## 12.8 Watchdog Timer \[J6]

The 1x3 2.54mm jumper is used to configure the system watchdog. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![J6 configurations settings for watchdog](broken-reference)

![J6 jumper configured to (a) Disable (b) Enable watchdog output to watchdog input](broken-reference)

## 12.9 DAQ Configuration \[J13]

The 2x3 2mm jumper J13 is used to set the configuration for the DAQ unit. The configurations are as tabulated below:

![J13 configuration settings for DAQ](broken-reference)

![J13 configured for (a) DAC in Biploar mode (b) ADC in Unipolar mode (c)ADC in Single ended mode](broken-reference)

## 12.10 Headless Mode \[J25]

The 2x5 2.54 header connector J25 for VGA is partly used to enable the system in headless mode.&#x20;
