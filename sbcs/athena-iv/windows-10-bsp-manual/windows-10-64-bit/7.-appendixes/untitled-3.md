# 7.4 APPENDIX D: WINDOWS 10 LICENSE ACTIVATION

Activation is the process of registering Windows 10 IoT Enterprise with Microsoft to ensure the product is genuine. Activation is used to:

* Reduce software piracy.&#x20;
* Protect the software industry, corporate intellectual property, software development investments, and product quality.&#x20;
* Ensure customers receive the product quality they expect.&#x20;

By default, you must enable each device for activation. If the device is not connected to the Internet, it will remain in a deferred activation state. If the device is connected to the Internet, the device will automatically activate over the Internet. If the device connects to the Internet and the activation attempt fails due to an invalid licensing key or one that has exceeded its activation allotment, it will enter a not activated state. Thus, there are three potential device states:&#x20;

**1.	Activated state**&#x20;

**3.	Not activated state**&#x20;

After a device has been activated, it will remain activated unless a significant change triggers a need to reactivate the device, such as a motherboard replacement or completely reimaging the device.

**Note: Connect Internet to Activate the License key.**
