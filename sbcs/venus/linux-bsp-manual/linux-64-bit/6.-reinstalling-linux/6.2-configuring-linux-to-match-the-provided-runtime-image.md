The user may require utilities like Eclipse IDE, partition manager, minicom etc. The freshly installed Ubuntu-OS will not have those utilities by default. To install required additional utilities refer Appendix J.

* Configure HTTP, FTP and SSH server

Refer [Appendix B](../appendix-b-configuration-of-ftp-server.md), C and D respectively

* Create new user and password if required

Refer [Appendix H](../appendix-h-to-create-and-change-of-root-user-password-ubuntu-new-user-creation.md)

* Enable automatic login option if required

Refer [Appendix k](../appendix-k-automatic-login-option.md)

* The Ubuntu-20.04.1 LTS kernel version 5.4.x has required drivers to support all the peripherals present in the Venus KBL board and now the Linux image is ready for the Venus KBL board.
* The next step is obviously to take a copy of the Venus KBL Linux image refer Appendix G
