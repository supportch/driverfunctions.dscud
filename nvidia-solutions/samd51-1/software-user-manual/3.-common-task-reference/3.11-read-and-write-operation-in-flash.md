# 3.11 Read and Write Operation in Flash

Driver supports reading from and writing to flash region in the address range 0 to 63487.

The SAMD51 function for writing to flash region is [DSCSAM\_FLASHWrite](../9.-samd51-apis/dscsam_flashwrite.md) and for reading from flash region is [DSCSAM\_FLASHRead](../9.-samd51-apis/dscsam_flashread.md).

### Step-By-Step Instructions

For writing in to flash region, user need to provide the address to which the data has to be written as well as the [BYTE](../5.-data-type-reference.md) data to be written in to flash region.

For reading from flash region, user need to provide the address from where the [BYTE](../5.-data-type-reference.md) data has to be read as well as the address of the buffer to store the [BYTE](../5.-data-type-reference.md) value read from the provided address.

```c
...

ERRPARAMS errparams;  // structure for returning error code and error string
int Address;
BYTE data;

...

// To write a data 24 at address 46

data = 24;
Address = 46;

if( DSCSAM_FLASHWrite(Address,data) != DE_NONE )
{
    DSCGetLastError ( &errparams );
    printf ( "DSCSAM_FLASHWrite error: %s %s\n", DSCGetErrorString ( errparams.ErrCode ), errparams.errstring );
    return 0;
}

// To read a BYTE value from address 46

Address = 46;

if( DSCSAM_FLASHRead(Address,&data) != DE_NONE )
{
    DSCGetLastError ( &errparams );
    printf ( "DSCSAM_FLASHRead error: %s %s\n", DSCGetErrorString ( errparams.ErrCode ), errparams.errstring );
    return 0;
}
		
...
```
