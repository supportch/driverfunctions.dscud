# 14 THERMAL SOLUTIONS

![Floyd-SC Active & Passive Heat Sinks](broken-reference)

The Jetson Nano and NX modules dissipate up to 15W under high load and require a thermal solution for effective heat dissipation. Diamond systems offers a heat sink , 6882610, or a fan sink, 6882612, for use on Floyd SC carrier card. The heat sink and fan sink part comes with all required installation hardware as well as thermal pads for high efficiency connection to the GPU chip on the Jetson module.

The heat sink or fan sink is not included with the Floyd SC carrier board but must be purchased separately. In Floyd SC complete systems the thermal solution is integrated into the enclosure, and no additional parts need to be purchased.

The fan specifications are shown below.
