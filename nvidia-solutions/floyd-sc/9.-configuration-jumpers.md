# 10. CONFIGURATION JUMPERS

## 10.1 Digital IO Configuration (JP1)

Jumpers are provided to enable pull-up/down on the Digital I/Os. By default, the DIOs are pulled down. The configuration is as shown below:

| Jumper Position     | Configuration                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1                   | Enable 3.3/5V pull-up to DIO Port A |
| **2\***             | **Enable pull-down to DIO Port A**  |
| 3                   | Enable 3.3/5V pull-up to DIO Port B |
| **4\***             | **Enable pull-down to DIO Port B**  |
| 5                   | Configure DIOs to be 5V complaint   |
| **6\***             | **Configure DIOs to be 3.3V**       |
| **\* Default Mode** |                                     |

10.2&#x20;USB2.0 Top Port Host/Device Select (JP2)
----------------------------------------

USB2.0 Top port of the base board is used as a device in the recovery mode to flash the module and is used as a Host in normal operation. This selection is achieved by changing the jumper positions on JP3 as tabulated below:



| Jumper Block        | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| D                   | USB2.0 port 1  Port as Device  for Recovery Mode |
| **H\***             | **USB2.0 port 1  Port as Host in Normal Mode**   |
| **\* Default Mode** |                                                  |

10.3&#x20;Serial Ports Configuration (JP3)
--------------------------------

The serial port protocol modes can be set with jumpers or with software. The protocol selection must either be done with or with software. If both the jumpers & software are used to set the protocol mode, priority is given to software. The protocol mode selection & termination enable for RS-485 operation mode with jumper is as tabulated below:

| **Jumper Position (JP3)** |        | **Configuration**                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1                         | IN     | Enable 121E termination for RS-485 mode operation  |
| 1                         | OUT    | Disable 121E termination for RS-485 mode operation |
| 2                         | IN     | Set SER 2 in RS-232                                |
| **3\***                   | **IN** | **Set SER 2 in RS-485**                            |
| **\*:- Default**          |        |                                                    |
