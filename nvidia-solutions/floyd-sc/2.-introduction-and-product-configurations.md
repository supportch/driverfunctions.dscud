# 2. INTRODUCTION & PRODUCT CONFIGURATIONS

## 2.1 Introduction

### 2.1.1 Floyd SC Carrier Board Overview

This product is a Jetson Nano/Xavier NX module based board with rich graphics and camera inputs capability. This base board converts the module into a complete embedded system by providing interface circuitry, I/O connectors for all the major features of the module, camera interface, power supply and additional I/O capabilities at a low cost. Floyd SC Base Board redefines possibility; a combination of performance, power efficiency, integrated deep learning capabilities and rich I/O remove the barriers to a new generation of low-cost products. The base board also contains M.2 x4 lane PCIe SSD. With the introduction of Jetson Xavier NX module, being a Nano pin-compatible module, the base board is equipped to provide CAN interface and an additional PCIe x1 lane which is not available on the Nano. An optional Board to Board expansion connector can be used along with Xavier NX module for additional expansion options.
