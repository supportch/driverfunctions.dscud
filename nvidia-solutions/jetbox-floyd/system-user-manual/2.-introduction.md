# 2. INTRODUCTION & PRODUCT CONFIGURATIONS

## 2.1 Introduction&#x20;

[JETBOX-FLOYD](http://www.diamondsystems.com/products/jetboxfloyd) is a compact Nvidia Jetson AI computing platform ready to deploy. It includes the Jetson Nano or NX module installed on Diamond Systems [FLOYD](http://www.diamondsystems.com/products/floyd) carrier board with a Linux OS installed and preconfigured to support all the I/Os on Floyd.

The system is available multiple standard configurations to meet a range of customer needs. The 01 full-feature models feature dual Ethernet ports with PoE support using an external power injector, two multi-protocol serial ports, dual HDMI displays, and a PCIe Minicard socket. The 02 low-cost models have fewer baseline I/O features but offer a faster-performance PCIe x4 NVME M.2 socket. Only the 01 model support one channel of CAN 2.0B with the Xavier NX module installed.

Jetbox-Floyd features multiple expansion sockets for additional I/O and storage capacity to meet a wide range of application needs. Dual SMA antenna cutouts support the installation of WiFi and cellular modem modules for network connectivity. The enclosure is DIN rail mountable or can be used in a "table top" scenario.

The system is compatible with both 12V and 24V DC power supplies. A 12VDC universal AC adapter is included with the system.

## 2.2 Product Configurations

Jetbox-Floyd is available in four standard baseline configurations of Jetson module and baseboard features:
