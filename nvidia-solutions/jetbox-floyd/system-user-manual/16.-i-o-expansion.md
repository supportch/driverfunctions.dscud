# 17. I/O EXPANSION SOCKETS

Jetbox-Floyd provides I/O expansion with M.2 PCIe M-Keyed 2280 sized & full-sized mPCIe sockets. The M.2 socket can be used for SSD applications while the mPCIe sockets can be used to install WiFi or GPS modules.

The M.2 & the mpCIe sockets are accessed by removing the TOP heat spreader plate from the Jetbox-Floyd. After installing the required M.2 and/or mPCIe modules, the Jetbox-Floyd TOP heat spreader plate can be assembled back to the Jetbox.

To ensure better receiving signal strength, Jetbox-Floyd provides two cut outs on the front panel. These cut outs case an SMA connector each, to which external antennas can be connected. See illustration below:

The mPCIe WiFi/GSM/LTE modules contain a U. FL connector onboard to use with an external antenna. This U.FL connector can be connected to the Antenna SMA connector on Jetbox-Floyd with **U.FL to SMA** **cables**.

The M.2 & mPCIe availability & characteristics are dependent on product configurations. Refer to [Section 2.2 Product Configurations](2.-introduction.md#2-2-product-configurations).
