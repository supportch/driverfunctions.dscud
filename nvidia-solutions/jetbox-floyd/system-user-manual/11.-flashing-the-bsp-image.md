# 11. POWER OVER ETHERNET

Jetbox-Floyd offers two PoE enabled ports. The Ethernet ports on Jetbox-Floyd are Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) ports. The PSE enabled ports supply power to Powered Device (PD). The PSE supply required is supplied to the carrier board through a separate power connector.&#x20;

When Jetbox-Floyd is connected to a PD and PoE power supplied, the PSE controller on Floyd carrier board negotiates the power required for the PD and enables the power. The power is overlaid over the data lines of the ethernet ports.

Jetbox-Floyd can independently negotiate with two separate PDs simultaneously. Jetbox-Floyd can power PoE devices to a maximum of up to 51W, 25.5W per port, provided the PoE input power supply can meet this power requirement.

Jetbox-Floyd PSE enabled ports are compliant to&#x20;**802.3at Type 2 "PoE+"**. The characteristics of 802.3at Type 2 "PoE+" are provided below:

Jetbox-Floyd injects power in Mode A i.e. pins 1 & 2 are DC+ and pins 3 & 6 are DC- on the RJ45 jacks.

The PoE functionality is present in the 01 models only . The PoE input power connector is exposed optionally on the front panel.
