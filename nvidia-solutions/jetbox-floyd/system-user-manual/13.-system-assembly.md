# 13. SYSTEM ASSEMBLY

![Jetbox-Floyd Exploded View](broken-reference)

Jetbox-Floyd assembly is basically split into two parts:

1. Installing the Jetson Module on Floyd
2. Installing Floyd inside the Jetbox

## 13.1 Installing the Jetson Module on Floyd

1. If not present on board, install 2 M2.5 x 6.5mm long spacers along board edge. See illustration below

2\. Insert module into socket at 45 degree angle. See illustration.

&#x20; 3\. Push down module so that both side latches click fully into position. The module PCB may have to be pushed down and module "clicks" into the connector.

**NOTE:** _The appearance of the module may differ depending upon the Jetson module installed._

## 13.2 Installing Floyd inside the Jetbox

1. Place appropriate thermal pad for the Jetson module being used into appropriate location onto bottom of heat spreader. See illustration. The NX module uses the larger pad, while the Nano module uses the smaller one. Only one or the other pad is needed; discard unused pad. Remove one liner to place the pad onto the heat sink. Then remove the second liner before installing the heat spreader onto the module. If the thermal pad liner is not removed, the thermal performance of the heat sink will be greatly reduced. This is a common oversight.
2. Mount the heat spreader on top of the assembled Floyd board. Use 4x M2.5x10 pan head screws to fix the heat spreader on the assembled Floyd.
3. Insert the assembled Floyd board with the heat spreader mounted on top into the enclosure. Check the connector alignment on the front panel of the enclosure.
4. Install the Floyd assembly to the enclosure bottom with 4x M3X6 pan head screws.
5.   &#x20;Place heat spreader over module, aligning mounting holes with the 4 spacers on Floyd. Press down gently.
6. Place the 44 x 34mm sized thermal pad on top of the heat spreader.&#x20;
7. If a front panel unused cable needs to be replaced, follow steps as below or skip to step 8
   1. Remove the unused existing cable from the front panel
   2. Connect the new required cable on the front panel
   3. Connect the cable to appropriate cable on the board
8. Align the heat sink plate onto the enclosure holes & screw down the heat sink plate to the enclosure with 4x M3x6 pan head screws.
