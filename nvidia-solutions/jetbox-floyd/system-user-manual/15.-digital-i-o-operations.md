# 15. DIGITAL I/O

Jetbox-Floyd provides 8 GPIOs optionally exposed on the front panel at connector  EXP 2. Refer to [Section 8.8 Digital I/Os (EXP 2) ](8.-i-o-connectors.md#8-8-digital-i-os-exp-2)for connector pinouts.

The DIOs on the JETBOX-FLOYD is realized using I2C to GPIO expander.&#x20;

The I2C GPIO expander can be addressed at 0x70 on on the bus /dev/i2c-0.

## 15.1 Digital I/O Specifications

The DIOs on Jetbox-Floyd are 3.3V output compliant & 5V input tolerant. The logic specifications are as follows:

| **Digital I/O Specifications** |                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Device                         | TCA9538                                        |
| Number of Lines                | 8                                              |
| Direction                      | Programmable bit by bit                        |
| Logic levels                   | 3.3V nominal outputs, 5V tolerant inputs       |
| Pull resistors                 | 10K ohms +/-1%; Jumper-selectable pull-up/down |
| **Input voltage**              |                                                |
| Logic 0:                       | -0.5V min, 0.66V max                           |
| Logic 1                        | 2.64V min, 5.5V max                            |
| **Output Voltage**             |                                                |
| Logic 0:                       | 0.0V min; 0.7V max @ 10mA output current       |
| Logic 1                        | 2.8V min @ -10mA output current; 3.3V max      |

Since the DIOs are realized with GPIO expanders, the DIOs do not provide any alternate functions but can only be used to drive logic high & logic low.

## 15.2 Software Commands

There are 3 commands to use the DIOs. They are as follows:

1. gpio\_util setdir

This command configures the direction of a particular DIO. For example, to set DIO 3 as an input & DIO 4 as an output, follow the command as provided below:

```
gpio_util setdir 3 in // sets DIO 3 as an input
gpio_util setdir 4 out // sets DIO 4 as an output 
```



2\. gpio\_util getdir

This command reads the direction of a particular DIO. For example, to read the direction of DIO 2 (earlier set as an input) & DIO 5 (earlier set as an output), use the command as follows:

```
readDir2 = gpio_util getdir 2 // returns the value "in"
readDir5 = gpio_util getdir 5 out // returns the value "out"
```

3\. gpio\_util setval

This command configures the logic driven to an output. For example, to drive a logic 0 to DIO 2 & a logic 1 to DIO 5, use the command as follows:

```
gpio_util setval 2 0 // drives DIO 2 as logic 0
gpio_util setval 5 1 // drives DIO 5 as logic 1 
```

4\. gpio\_util getval

This command reads the logic at an input pin. For example, to read the logic value at DIO 6, use the command as follows:

```
read6 = gpio_util getval 6 // reads the logic of DIO 6
```
